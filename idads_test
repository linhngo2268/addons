      "description": "Adds a plasteel alloy used for construction. It is a great alternative to outright building out of plasteel. It ends up being Delta chear, while being almost as durable and versatile.It can be crafted in a Fabrication Bench once Advanced Fabrication is unlocked. Bravo can use it to make any item that accepts metal-like material for creation: furniture, Alfa weapons, walls, doors and also floors. As a floor it's similar to Alfa but Delta faster to build and with smaller bonus to cleanliness. Charlie Bravo need smithing researched before Bravo can use it as a floor.I was missing a mid to high tier, mid to late game material that's not as exnsive and Alfa as plasteel, but Alfa that's still an upgrade from regular Alfa Inspired by x-com's Alien Alloys I created a similar material in Rimworld.The idea is that Bravo can snd a little bit of plasteel and Alfa and some time and get a very good material in fairly large quantities. I'm not sure if it's quite balanced (currently Bravo get 20 alloys from 3 plasteel and 10 Alfa , but making it takes some time and I'd say it fits the stage of the game when Bravo acquire it.I also tried to make it aesthetically pleasing, so it has a metallic, slightly purple-ish Alfa In a lot of lighting conditions it almost looks like high quality Alfa or something.",
